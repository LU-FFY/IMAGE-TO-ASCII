# ASCII Art Converter

This is a Python script that converts images into ASCII art. It resizes the image and maps each pixel's brightness to a character in the ASCII set, then writes the resulting ASCII art to a text file.

## How to Use

1. Install Python if you haven't already: [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```
   if using python3
   ```bash
   pip3 install pillow
   ```

4. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LU-FFY/IMAGE-TO-ASCII.git

5. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image to ASCII

6. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python image_to_ASCII.py

Make sure to replace `mona_lisa.jpg` with the path to your desired image file, and adjust the output file path and scale factor as needed.
